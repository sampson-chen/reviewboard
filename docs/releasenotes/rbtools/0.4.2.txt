===========================
RBTools 0.4.2 Release Notes
===========================

**Release date**: September 24, 2012


New Features
============

* The :file:`.post-review-cookies.txt` file is now made readable only by
  the calling user, improving security. (:bug:`2231`)

* Improved debug output.

  The debug output now includes additional information on the user's
  environment, in order to help diagnose problems.

  When a command fails, we'll still show the debugging information, even
  if we ignore the error.

  It also will show log output from other Python modules we call,
  such as hg.

  Parts of this were written by Craig Silverstein.

* Updated our Plastic support for Plastic 4.0. This is no longer
  compatible with previous versions.

  Patch by Luis Rodriguez.

* A revision to diff against can now be specified when using hgsubversion.
  Patch by Frank Murphy.


Bug Fixes
=========

General
-------

* Using UTF-8 in the summary or description no longer breaks.
  Patch by Karsten Verelst. (:bug:`2616`)

* The GNU diff error no longer mentions Subversion specifically.

* Posting a diff to a submitted review request now displays an error
  instead of reopening the review request. Patch by Bogdana Popa.
  (:bug:`2549`)


Clear Case
----------

* Fixed base path generation for Clear Case. Patch by Tomasz Moń.


Git
---

* Fix issues when running post-review within a git submodule with recent
  Git revisions. (:bug:`2526`)

  On recent versions of Git, the :file:`.git` directory for a submodule was
  relocated to being in the top-level project instead of in the worktree
  of the submodule. We now handle this case.

  Patch by Nicolas Morey.

* Git diffs no longer include diffs from submodules, preventing useless
  diffs from being created. Patch by Amber Yust.

* post-review no longer breaks when run from a detached Git HEAD.
  Patch by Nicolas Morey.


Mercurial
---------

* Fixed bailing on harmless warnings when running hg commands.
  Patch by Craig Silverstein.

* Fixed path calculation for hgsubversion when the path contains a
  username. Patch by Frank Murphy.


Subversion
----------

* Scanning for the right repository is much faster now when there are lots
  of Subversion repositories on the server.

* Fix handling of revisions with deleted files for Subversion.
  (:bug:`1113`)

* Handle modifications inside moved/copied directories for Subversion.

  post-review no longer has problems when dealing with a modified file
  inside a copied or moved directory.

  Patch by Alexey Neyman.
